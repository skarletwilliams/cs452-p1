I haven't finished this, sorry to report. It's been so long since I programmed in C that this was already going to be difficult, but unfortunately the breakup made me procrastinate much harder. Conceptually for step 6 I know that I need to tokenize the input but I was struggling with messing around with strings in C, I don't remember exactly how and when it's this close to the deadline I simply panic and have no clue. I didn't get the chance to explore further concepts, and I honestly feel like I'm struggling with them conceptually anyway so I would have had a difficult time either way.
